function [v,f] = patch2v(patmat,frqmat,dim,patchsize)
%PATCH2V Aggregate overlapped patches to a whole video.
%   [v,f]=PATCH2V(patchmat,frqmat,dim,patchsize) returns the aggregated video
%   from overlapped patches patchmat and the corresponding freqency matrix
%   for each patch frqmat. This function is an inverse of the im2patch
%   function and would preform aggregation block-wise as well.
%   See also WNNM_VDENOISE, V2PATCH.
