%NEIGHBORIND Pre-calculation of the indexes of the neighbors within the

%   [neighborindarr,neighbornumarr,selfindarr]=NEIGHBORIND(dim,opt) returns

%                       neighbor patch indexes for each key patch,
%    neighbornumarr   - number of neighbors in gridind (grid index) within
%                       search window, which is a row vector and each
%                       column corresponds to that of neighborindarr,
