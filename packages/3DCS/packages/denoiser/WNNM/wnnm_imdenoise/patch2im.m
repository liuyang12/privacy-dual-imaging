function im = patch2im(patchmat,frqmat,dim,patchsize)
%PATCH2IM Aggregate overlapped patches to a whole image.
%   im=PATCH2IM(patchmat,frqmat,dim,patchsize) returns the aggregated image
%   from overlapped patches patchmat and the corresponding freqency matrix
%   for each patch frqmat. This function is an inverse of the im2patch
%   function and would preform aggregation block-wise as well.
%   See also WNNM_IMDENOISE, IM2PATCH.
